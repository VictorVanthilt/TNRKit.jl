# TNRKit.jl
---
Is a Julia package that aims to implement as much tensor network renormalization (TNR) schemes as possible.
It is built upon
[TensorKit.jl](https://github.com/jutho/TensorKit.jl), which provides functionality for
generic symmetries.

The project is not registered (yet) and is under active development. The interface is subject to changes. Any feedback about the user interface or the internals is much appreciated.
