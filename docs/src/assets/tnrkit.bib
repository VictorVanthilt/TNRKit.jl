	abstract = {We propose an improved tensor renormalization-group (TRG) algorithm, the bond-weighted TRG (BTRG). In BTRG, we generalize the conventional TRG by introducing bond weights on the edges of the tensor network. We show that BTRG outperforms the conventional TRG and the higher-order tensor renormalization group with the same bond dimension, whereas its computation time is almost the same as that of TRG. Furthermore, BTRG can have nontrivial fixed-point tensors at an optimal hyperparameter. We demonstrate that the singular value spectrum obtained by BTRG is invariant under the renormalization procedure in the case of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical point. This property indicates that BTRG performs the tensor contraction with high accuracy whereas keeping the scale-invariant structure of tensors.},

	abstract = {We introduce a tensor renormalization group scheme for coarse graining a two-dimensional tensor network that can be successfully applied to both classical and quantum systems on and off criticality. The key innovation in our scheme is to deform a 2D tensor network into small loops and then optimize the tensors on each loop. In this way, we remove short-range entanglement at each iteration step and significantly improve the accuracy and stability of the renormalization flow. We demonstrate our algorithm in the classical Ising model and a frustrated 2D quantum model.},

	abstract = {We describe a simple real space renormalization group technique for two-dimensional classical lattice models. The approach is similar in spirit to block spin methods, but at the same time it is fundamentally based on the theory of quantum entanglement. In this sense, the technique can be thought of as a classical analogue of the density matrix renormalization group method. We demonstrate the method—which we call the tensor renormalization group method—by computing the magnetization of the triangular lattice Ising model.},

	abstract = {We propose a different tensor renormalization group algorithm, anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG), for lattice models in arbitrary dimensions. The proposed method shares the same versatility with the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) algorithm, i.e., it preserves the lattice topology after the renormalization. In comparison with HOTRG, both the computation cost and the memory footprint of our method are drastically reduced, especially in higher dimensions, by renormalizing tensors in an anisotropic way after the singular value decomposition. We demonstrate the ability of ATRG for the square lattice and the simple cubic lattice Ising models. Although the accuracy of the present method degrades when compared with HOTRG of the same bond dimension, the accuracy with fixed computation time is improved greatly due to the drastic reduction of the computation cost.},
