# TNRKit

**Your one-stop-shop for Tensor Network Renormalization.**

# Package summary
TNRKit.jl aims to provide as many Tensor Network Renormalization methods as possible. Several models like the classical Ising, Potts and Six Vertex models are provided.

You can use TNRKit for calculating:
1. Partition functions (classical & quantum)
2. CFT data
3. Central charges

Many common TNR schemes have already been implemented:
* [`TRG`](@ref)
* [`BTRG`](@ref)
* [`ATRG`](@ref)
* [`LoopTNR`](@ref)

TNRKit has received funding by:
- Fonds voor Wetenschappenlijk Onderzoek (FWO)
- The European Research Council
